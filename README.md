# Puzzle_Game
The "Puzzle Game" is a Python program where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The player inputs their guess, and the program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, and the program displays the number of attempts made.
